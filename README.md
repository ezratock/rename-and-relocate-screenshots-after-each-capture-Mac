# rename-and-relocate-screenshots-after-each-capture-Mac
A script that takes a screenshot in interactive mode but then prompts the user to rename and relocate it.  Easy to trigger the script with a custom keyboard shortcut or function key!  The default name and location are the same defaults stored on your Mac.
